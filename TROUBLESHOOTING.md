# Troubleshooting Guide for Camera and Blockchain Issues

## Camera Issues

### 1. Camera Permission Denied
**Problem**: Camera access is blocked by the browser
**Solution**: 
- Click the camera icon in the browser address bar
- Select "Allow" for camera access
- Refresh the page and try again

### 2. Camera Not Found
**Problem**: No camera detected on the device
**Solution**:
- Ensure your device has a camera
- Check if another application is using the camera
- Close other apps that might be using the camera
- Try refreshing the page

### 3. Camera Already in Use
**Problem**: Camera is being used by another application
**Solution**:
- Close other applications that might be using the camera
- Check for video conferencing apps, photo apps, etc.
- Restart your device if the issue persists

### 4. Camera Constraints Not Supported
**Problem**: Browser doesn't support the requested camera settings
**Solution**:
- Update your browser to the latest version
- Try using a different browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari)
- The app will automatically fall back to supported settings

### 5. HTTPS Required
**Problem**: Camera API requires secure connection
**Solution**:
- Ensure you're accessing the app via HTTPS
- For local development, use `npm run dev` which provides HTTPS

## Blockchain Connection Issues

### 1. Thirdweb Client ID Missing
**Problem**: Thirdweb configuration not set up
**Solution**:
- Get a Thirdweb Client ID from [thirdweb.com](https://thirdweb.com)
- Create a `.env` file in your project root
- Add: `VITE_THIRDWEB_CLIENT_ID=your_client_id_here`

### 2. Smart Contract Not Available
**Problem**: Smart contract address not configured
**Solution**:
- Deploy your smart contract to Polygon network
- Update the contract address in your environment variables
- Add: `VITE_SMART_CONTRACT_ADDRESS=your_contract_address_here`

### 3. Wallet Not Connected
**Problem**: No wallet connected
**Solution**:
- Install any supported wallet (MetaMask, WalletConnect, Coinbase Wallet, etc.)
- Connect your wallet to the Polygon network
- Ensure you have some MATIC for gas fees
- Refresh the page and try connecting again

### 4. Wrong Network
**Problem**: Wallet connected to wrong blockchain network
**Solution**:
- Switch your wallet to Polygon network
- Add Polygon network if not available:
  - Network Name: Polygon
  - RPC URL: https://polygon-rpc.com
  - Chain ID: 137
  - Currency Symbol: MATIC

### 5. Insufficient Gas Fees
**Problem**: Not enough MATIC for transaction fees
**Solution**:
- Add MATIC to your wallet
- You can get test MATIC from Polygon faucet for testing

## Environment Setup

### Required Environment Variables
Create a `.env` file in your project root:

```env
# Thirdweb Configuration
VITE_THIRDWEB_CLIENT_ID=your_thirdweb_client_id_here

# Smart Contract Configuration
VITE_SMART_CONTRACT_ADDRESS=your_contract_address_here

# Google Cloud Vision API (Optional)
VITE_GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT_ID=your_project_id_here
VITE_GOOGLE_CLOUD_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```

### Getting Thirdweb Client ID
1. Go to [thirdweb.com](https://thirdweb.com)
2. Sign up/Login to your account
3. Go to Settings ‚Üí API Keys
4. Create a new API key
5. Copy the Client ID

### Getting Smart Contract Address
1. Deploy your AttendanceContract.sol to Polygon network
2. Copy the deployed contract address
3. Update your environment variables

## Testing Steps

### 1. Test Camera First
1. Open the CameraTest component
2. Check if camera devices are detected
3. Try starting the camera
4. Test image capture functionality

### 2. Test Wallet Connection
1. Go to the Wallet Test page (`/wallet-test`)
2. Try connecting different wallet types
3. Verify connection status
4. Run wallet tests to check functionality

### 3. Test Blockchain Connection
1. Check browser console for connection errors
2. Verify wallet connection status
3. Test contract interaction
4. Check network configuration

### 4. Test Full Flow
1. Select a session
2. Start camera and capture image
3. Process face recognition
4. Mark attendance
5. Verify blockchain transaction
